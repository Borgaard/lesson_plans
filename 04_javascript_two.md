### How do you find the minimum value of Array?
Check each cabinet one by one.
Check the first cabinet, arr[0], is this smallest?
It is the smallest out of the ones I've seen so far so I'll hold onto it
Check the second cabinet, arr[1], is it smaller than what I'm holding onto?

### How do you find the maximum value of Array?
Check each cabinet one by one.
Check the first cabinet, arr[0], is this biggest?
It is the biggest out of the ones I've seen so far so I'll hold onto it
Check the second cabinet, arr[1], is it bigger than what I'm holding onto?

### How do you find average value of Array?
Check each cabinet one by one
Have a place to store the aggregate of all of the cabinet's values
When we get to the end of the Array we should have sum of all elements
Divide by the number of elements that were there

### Print all numbers divisible by 3 from 1 to 100
Go through numbers 1 through 100
If the number we are going through is divisible by three, log
else move onto the next number

### Print all numbers divisible by 5 from 1 to 100
Go through numbers 1 through 100
If the number we are going through is divisible by five, log
else move onto the next number

### Print all numbers divisible by 3 and 5 from 1 to 100
Go through numbers 1 through 100
If the number we are going through is divisible by three AND five, log
else move onto the next number

### FizzBuzz
Go through numbers 1 through 100
If the number we are going through is divisible by three AND five, log FizzBuzz
If the number we are going through is divisible by three, log Fizz
If the number we are going through is divisible by five, log Buzz
else just log the number

### How do you implement Linear Search?
Check each cabinet one by one.
Check the first cabinet, arr[0], does it have what we want?
Check the second cabinet, arr[1], does it have what we want?
If we get to the end and we didn't find it, it doesn't exist in the Array

### Factorial
1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5

### Convert our solutions into functions so we can reuse them.
